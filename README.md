# CityAirWatch

**This project combines hardware and software components to create a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor data receiver. 
It includes a custom-built ESP32 board with a sensor for measuring temperature and humidity and an Android app developed using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. 
The app connects to the ESP32 device and displays real-time sensor data with animated color changes.**

## Hardware Components

- Custom-built ESP32 board.
- Temperature and humidity sensor (specific sensor model).
- Additional hardware components used for building and connecting the ESP32 board.

## Software Technologies

- Android app developed using Jetpack Compose for UI.
- Kotlin programming language for Android app development.
- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) for communication between the app and the ESP32 device.
- Custom Arduino sketch uploaded to the ESP32 board for sensor data acquisition.
  

## Features:

- Connects to a custom-built ESP32 device with a BLE module.
- Receives temperature and humidity data from the sensor on the ESP32 board.
- Displays real-time data on the Android app with dynamic color changes based on sensor readings.
